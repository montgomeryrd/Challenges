<h2>Highest Rank Number in an Array</h2>

Write a method highestRank(arr) (or highest-rank in clojure) which returns the number which is most frequent in the given input array (or ISeq). If there is a tie for most frequent number, return the largest number of which is most frequent.

Example:
```
arr = [12, 10, 8, 12, 7, 6, 4, 10, 12];
highestRank(arr) //=> returns 12

arr = [12, 10, 8, 12, 7, 6, 4, 10, 12, 10];
highestRank(arr) //=> returns 12

arr = [12, 10, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 10, 12, 10];
highestRank(arr) //=> returns 3
